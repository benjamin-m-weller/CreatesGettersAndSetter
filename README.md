# CreatesGettersAndSetter
This project is simply for my friends who are taking Java II, oftentimes writing the boilerplate code is very tedious. As such, my project takes the instance variable declarations that are copied on the system clipboard and generates "getters"/"setters" for them. Following that, my program places them back on the clipboard.

This project holds a great deal of firsts:
•	First time I seriously took a look at code expansion
•	First time I interacted with the system keyboard
•	First time I thought “Wow, this would be so much easier in Python.”
